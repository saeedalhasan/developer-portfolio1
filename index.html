            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing building, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's
                why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become Web Development Hero.

            <p>I already learned the basic HTML & CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my Grandma how
                to make a simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advance topics.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I know everything needed to make a website function
                    efficient.
                    I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with the most popular JavaScript framework called Vue JS.
                    I
                    even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
